### How to use the app

Download the app directly using the below link or use the above instructions to use it in your local development environment. After you lunch the app you will first see products screen where you can add the products you like to checkout screen. Beware, I used async storage in this app so after you add an item you might not see it immediately in the checkout screen sometimes you wait a little or closed the app and relunch it again, this app can be used offline to add a product to checkout screen.
In the checkout screen you can remove an item or place your order. Thank you!
